// Package modal implements the provider.Provider interface for Modal
// (https://modal.com), a serverless GPU compute platform.
//
// Modal's shape drives several adapter decisions:
//   - Lifecycle is create/terminate only — no stop/resume, so SupportsStop=false.
//   - The pinned Go SDK exposes no spot knob (Modal's own API has one), so
//     SupportsSpot=false. Placement SKIPS a Spot candidate rather than downgrading it
//     silently, so only OnDemand requests reach here and CapacityType is never read.
//   - Region is OPTIONAL, unlike AWS: Modal places freely when none is given, and that
//     unconstrained mode is both the widest capacity pool and the cheapest — pinning
//     costs 1.5x (broad, "us") or 1.75x (narrow, "us-east") on the whole bill. So empty
//     is the preferred path, not a fallback. The vocabulary is Modal's own and needs no
//     translation table.
//   - A pool's regions go out in ONE call rather than being walked. Create never fails
//     on capacity (it queues), so nothing would re-drive placement to a second region
//     and walking would strand the workload in whichever came first. Modal's scheduler
//     has the live capacity view, so ResolveRegions collapses the declaration into one
//     opaque candidate and regionsOf splits it back at the API boundary. The cost is
//     blocklist precision, which is free here since no Modal failure is
//     region-attributable.
//   - The image's ENTRYPOINT is PREPENDED to the sandbox argv, where Kubernetes has
//     `command` replace it. The adapter clears the entrypoint to restore the Kubernetes
//     contract; see imageFor.
//   - Sandboxes carry native tags, so NativeTags=true and ClaimName is a tag rather
//     than smuggled into the instance name.
//   - There is no preemption push; detection is poll-based.
//
// The concrete Modal API lives behind the Client seam, so this package holds only
// provider-agnostic translation and is unit-testable without network access.
